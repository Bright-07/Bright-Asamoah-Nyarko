## ðŸš€ About Me

I am a learner of the **ALX Software Engineering** program and I want to revamp my GitHub Profile to make it stand out from the crowd in my job search.  
I began this journey because I believe technology has the power to **transform healthcare**, improve lives, and bridge access gapsâ€”especially in underserved communities.

ðŸ’¡ **What Iâ€™m passionate about:**
- Building meaningful backend systems and APIs  
- Exploring tech solutions in health and education  
- Learning to create full-stack applications with impact  

ðŸŽ¯ **My Vision:**
To become a **well-rounded software engineer** who can design and build digital tools that enhance healthcare and drive innovation. Iâ€™m eager to collaborate on **projects at the intersection of medicine and technology**, especially in Africa.
